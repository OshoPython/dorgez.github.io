## Introduction

Ever wished you could automate repetitive tasks on your computer? Whether it's fixing typos, launching apps with a keystroke, or creating powerful macros, **AutoHotkey (AHK)** is the perfect tool. It's lightweight, powerful, and easy to learn. In this guide, we'll explore the basics of AHK syntax and help you get started with simple yet effective scripts.

## What is AutoHotkey?

AutoHotkey is a free scripting language for Windows that lets you automate tasks using hotkeys, macros, and text expansion. You can:

- Remap keys and mouse buttons
- Create text shortcuts
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Control windows and applications

### Getting Started

To use AutoHotkey, download and install it from [https://www.autohotkey.com/](https://www.autohotkey.com/). Once installed, create a new `.ahk` file, open it in a text editor, and start scripting!

---

## 1. Creating Hotkeys

Hotkeys allow you to execute actions with a simple key combination. Hereâ€™s how you create one:

```code
; This script opens Notepad when you press Win + N
#n::Run Notepad
```

### Explanation:

- `#` represents the **Windows key**.
- `n` is the key to trigger the action.
- `::` separates the key from the action.
- `Run Notepad` launches Notepad.

### Other Modifier Keys:

|Symbol|Key|
|---|---|
|`^`|Ctrl|
|`!`|Alt|
|`+`|Shift|
|`#`|Windows|

Example: Open Calculator with `Ctrl + Alt + C`:

```code
^!c::Run Calc
```

## 2. AutoCorrect and Text Expansion

AHK is fantastic for fixing typos automatically or expanding shortcuts into full text.

```
::teh::the

::brb::Be right back

::omw::On my way!
```

```python 
Estimated Location: -0.53
Estimated Scale: 49.28
Estimated Shape: 11.49
```

Now, every time you type `teh`, AHK will automatically replace it with `the`.

---

## 3. Remapping Keys

If you want to swap keys or disable them, AHK makes it easy.

`CapsLock::Ctrl  ; Turn Caps Lock into a Ctrl key.`

`Esc::F7  ; Make Escape key type a F7`

---

## 4. Sending Keystrokes

You can simulate typing and shortcuts using the `Send` command.

`^t::Send, Hello, this is an AutoHotkey script!`

This sends the text when you press `Ctrl + T`.

---

## 5. Running Programs and Opening Websites

Quickly open apps or websites with hotkeys:

```code
#b::Run https://www.bing.com
```

---

## 6. Creating Message Boxes

Display a popup message:

```code
F2::MsgBox, Hello! This is an AutoHotkey message box.
```

---

## 7. Using Loops for Automation

Automate repetitive tasks with loops.

```code
F3::
Loop 5
{
    Send, Hello!{Enter}
    Sleep, 1000  ; Wait 1 second
}
return
```

Press `F3`, and it will type "Hello!" five times, pausing for one second between each.
